[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbritishlibrary%2Fcomputing_for_cultural_heritage_2.0&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fcomputing_for_cultural_heritage_2.0%2Fnotebooks%2Fpre_work.ipynb&branch=main)

This is the environment repo for the Binder. Data and notebooks are held in the [content repo](https://github.com/harrylloyd-bl/incu-binder-content-repo/tree/hny-0924), which is what is displayed when the binder link opens. This set-up [improves load times](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/external_binder_setup.html) while developing the Binder.

## Project information

As part of the Digital Scholarship Training Programme (DSTP), we plan to address the organisational need for an introduction to programming course in a cultural heritage context. This course will follow on from the successful 2019-2020 trial of the Computing for Cultural Heritage PgCert, building on existing materials and using in-house expertise for development and delivery. The offer will teach a cohort of staff the fundamentals of programming, aiming to increase institutional capacity to meet business needs, support computationally driven research projects and digital initiatives, and expand the community of practice into new areas of the Library.
